## Documentation: Chat-Based Interface with Streamlit, Vector Database, and RAG Model 

Overview
This document provides a detailed explanation of the process flow for a chat-based interface application. The application uses Streamlit for the front-end, interacts with a large codebase through a vector database, and employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for processing and generating responses.

## Process Steps
User Interaction with Streamlit: The user initiates the process by interacting with the Streamlit front-end. This interaction typically involves submitting a query or request related to the codebase.

Streamlit to Backend Communication: The Streamlit application forwards the user's query to the backend server. This step involves transmitting data from the front-end to the server where the main processing occurs.

Query Processing in Backend: Upon receiving the query, the backend processes it. This includes parsing, understanding the query's context, and preparing it for further processing with the vector database and the RAG model.

Interaction with Vector Database: The processed query is then used to retrieve relevant data from the vector database. This database contains the large codebase, organized in a manner that facilitates efficient search and retrieval.

RAG Model Processing: The RAG model utilizes the query and the data retrieved from the vector database to generate a response. This model is designed to find the most relevant code snippets or information from the codebase in relation to the user's query.

Sending Response Back to Streamlit: The generated response, along with any tree structure visualization, is sent back to the Streamlit front-end.

Displaying Results to User: The Streamlit application then presents the results to the user in an intuitive and easy-to-understand format.

### Extra -  

User Query Embedding: The query is embedded, meaning it is converted into a vector representation that can be understood and processed by the system.

Semantic Search in Vector Database: This step involves semantic search within the vector database. Documents (code files) are reverse indexed and ranked based on their relevance to the embedded user query.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the power of retrieval (finding relevant documents/code files) and language generation. It retrieves relevant information and then uses a language model to generate a coherent response.
Response Generation and Tree Structure Creation: Based on the output from the RAG model, this step generates the response, which could be code suggestions, explanations, etc. A tree structure might be created to visually represent the relationships and dependencies in the data or code.

Feedback Loop: There's an implicit feedback loop in the system. User interactions and system responses contribute to continuous learning and improvement of the model, enhancing accuracy and relevance over time.)
